The basics of coding like main theory i received at w3schools.com
Theory like different operators, variables, classes and more!
The second place was youtube that is currently giving me a bit of useful information about Java and coding in general

Right now i am moving forward through w3resource.com and w3schools.com.
Pretty interesting to create new codes from 0 and ofcourse to learn how to interact with Java IDE that i am using. It is Eclipse IDE workspace.
